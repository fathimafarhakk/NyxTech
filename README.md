# [QUEUE GUIDE] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [NyxTech]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [fathima farha kk] - [EMEA college of arts and science]
- Member 2: [Ayisha ishra kk] - [EMEA college of arts and science]

### Hosted Project Link
[visit here](https://fathimafarhakk.github.io/NyxTech/)

### Project Description
[QueueGuide is a real-time digital queue management system that allows users to book and track service tokens online, reducing physical waiting time.

Staff can manage token flow, update live serving status, and monitor service performance through a Firebase-powered dashboard.

The system supports multiple locations with centralized live updates for accurate queue tracking.]

### The Problem statement
[Long physical waiting times and lack of real-time visibility in service queues cause frustration, inefficiency, and overcrowding.]
### The Solution
[A real-time, location-based digital queue system that allows users to book tokens online and track their turn while staff manage and update the queue through a live dashboard.?]
